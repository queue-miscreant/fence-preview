fence-preview
=============

A plugin for previewing images from nvim.
Somewhat of a reimplementation of [vim-graphical-preview](https://github.com/bytesnake/vim-graphical-preview),
which refused to compile on my Linux box.

A sister project to [nvim-image-extmarks](https://github.com/queue-miscreant/nvim-image-extmarks),
which it depends upon.

- ImageMagick
- LaTeX (optional)

TODOs
-----

- Asynchronous content is courteous of nodes and extmarks already in the buffer
- [-] Open fence content in split
    - "Phantom" preamble for "math" (TeX) content
    - Height can be controlled by a comment in the split
- Forced heights use folds outside of fences
    - Open fold by entering split
    - This requires extra logic for extmark height!
- More (configurable) pipeline-like architecture
    - Errors along the LaTeX toolchain render as extmark errors
    - "Run" content should take arguments from closing ` ``` `
    - Ex. ` ```image,height=3 ` displays the image generated by the code
    - Ex. ` ```latex ` displays the LaTeX generated by the code
- Default LaTeX display is not eye-searing
    - Simple: white text on black
    - Difficult: configurable, white text on transparent
    - Hide content with highlights
    - Highlight removed when cursor crosses fence
